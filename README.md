# My-Anki-Flashcards
The Anki flashcards that I'm using in university RN.
These flashcards have no intent of being neither complete nor perfect. It's just what I'm using and what i find comfortable studying with.
I'm still trying to figure out how the hell does LaTeX work on Anki. 
For the rest, everything written/drawn has been done by me.
